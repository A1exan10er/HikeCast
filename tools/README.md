## Duplicate Code Detection & Removal Tools

### üìÑ `remove_duplicates.py`
**Purpose**: Automated duplicate code detection and removal for JavaScript files
- Detects complete duplicate code blocks (functions, endpoints, etc.)
- Safely removes duplicates while preserving essential functionality
- Includes syntax validation to ensure code integrity after removal
- Used to clean up `index.js` and reduce file size by 28.7% (741 lines removed)

**Usage:**
```bash
python tools/remove_duplicates.py <filename>
```

**Features:**
- Intelligent pattern recognition for duplicate sections
- Safe removal with boundary detection
- Automatic syntax validation using Node.js
- Progress reporting and statistics

### üìä `check_database.py`
**Purpose**: Duplicate detection analysis for `database.js`
- Scans database management file for duplicate code patterns
- Reports findings without making modifications
- Validates code structure and identifies potential cleanup opportunities

**Usage:**
```bash
python tools/check_database.py
```

**Output:**
- Duplicate pattern analysis
- File statistics and recommendations
- Clean code verification

### üé® `check_dashboard.py`
**Purpose**: Duplicate detection analysis for `views/dashboard.html`
- Analyzes dashboard HTML file for redundant code sections
- Checks for duplicate CSS, JavaScript, or HTML blocks
- Reports findings for manual review

**Usage:**
```bash
python tools/check_dashboard.py
```

**Output:**
- HTML/CSS/JS duplicate analysis
- File size and structure statistics
- Code quality recommendations

## Tool Development History

These tools were created during the major codebase cleanup in July 2025:

1. **Problem Identified**: `index.js` contained 741 lines of duplicated code (28.7% of file)
2. **Solution Developed**: Python scripts for automated detection and safe removal
3. **Implementation**: Successful cleanup while maintaining all functionality
4. **Verification**: All core files validated for integrity and cleanliness

## Results Achieved

- **index.js**: Reduced from 2,578 to 1,837 lines (28.7% reduction)
- **database.js**: Verified clean (425 lines, no duplicates)
- **dashboard.html**: Verified clean (1,439 lines, no duplicates)

## Best Practices

1. **Always backup** files before running removal tools
2. **Validate syntax** after any code modifications
3. **Test functionality** to ensure nothing was broken
4. **Review changes** manually before committing

## Dependencies

- **Python 3.x**: Required for all scripts
- **Node.js**: Used for JavaScript syntax validation
- **Standard Libraries**: `re`, `os`, `subprocess`, `sys`
